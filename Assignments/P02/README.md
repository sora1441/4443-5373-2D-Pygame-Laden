## Project: Platfromer jumper
### Name: Brent Laden
### Description: This program will play a game where the play's objective is to collect 15 medals. With every 3 items, the player will get a jump boost.
#### **Note: Had to change to adopt KidsCanCode starter code because other code was not working at all. Also was not able to get the splash page to work.
### Instructions: Type python main.py into the command prompt of python to run. Press any key to start the game and use the arrow keys to move and space bar to jump
