## Project: Json Player Info
### Name: Brent Laden
#### Description: This program pulls the information from a json file and loads it into a dictionary used by python to store data. The json file is selected by importing it at the beginning of the program. It then extracts the information and stores it. The information is then formatted and exported to a window for the user to read.
##### Instructions: Type python main.py into the command prompt of python to run. Since the json file is called within main, there is no need to do anything more.
